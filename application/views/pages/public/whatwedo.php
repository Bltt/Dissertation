					Feeling competitive? As an air cadet you can take part in seven main sports at different levels - athletics, cross country, football, rugby, hockey, netball and swimming. Whatever you do it'll help improve your physical fitness levels and your team skills. If you're good enough at your favourite sport we'll notice, and can help you take it to the next level.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify m-3">
					Adventurous Training is an essential part of the Air Cadet's training syllabus and the place where team effort really matters - you'll build new friendships, and learn to rely on the other people you're with to get the job done. It also lets you show off your leadership qualities.
